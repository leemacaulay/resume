# Yaml Resume

Hello! This is mostly for my personal use as I get too confused writing in json, so I write my [jsonresume](jsonresume.org) in yaml before converting it using yq. 

Once you have installed, yq you should be able to run `make` in this folder to easily convert your resume.yaml to resume.json for further use.

# How to update resume

1. Make changes to resume.yaml in a text editor - `code resume.yaml`

2. Run `make` to convert yaml file to resume.json and c5ee.../resume.json

3. Update Github gist by entering cfee.../ folder and running `git add .` then `git commit -m 'your message'
 
4. Run `git commit origin master`
