  summary: Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm a journalist with more than six years' of newsroom experience and, now, I work at cutting edge of audio news. I was part of the launch team for the world's first interactive news bulletin service for smart speakers. I've worked in newsrooms for BBC News, BBC Local Radio and commercial radio stations in the north of England. My writing style is concise, precise and tailor-made for the internet. I know just enough about coding to be dangerous too.
